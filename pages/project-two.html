    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>This is a project created by 4 designers for an Interaction Design (IAT 333) course. The IAT 333 class project involves working directly with a participant group to expand our knowledge and skills about interactive design and its methods.</p>
    <p>Paper Poet is a specialty paper and letter press studio based in Langley, BC, Canada. They cater to people who could not find custom printing products and services that is unique to their needs.</p>

    <h3>PROCESS</h3>
    <p>By learning more about Paper Poet through our continuous meetings, my team and I were able to identify the initial problems and concerns Paper Poet had – minimal online presence, change in client base, COVID-19 impact on physical store. We began by executing ethnography research, followed by personas, user journey maps, and story boarding to address their problems. Along the way, we realized that we were going to the wrong direction and our goal began to drift off. As the leader, I encouraged the team to reflect and re-analyze the interview we had with our client and its customers, and reviewed any evaluation method we created.</p>
    <p>Thus, we were able to strengthen and redirect our focus: “How might we help potential customers establish trust and gain concrete understanding of Paper Poet by better communicating their services while minimizing in-person visits?”. With this, we designed a web catalogue and mood board feature. This solution will help in reshaping experience to garner user interest, create engagement and interaction with the business, deepen understanding of business, and encourage creativity.  When creating our solutions, I oversaw the graphic design of the catalogue and mood board feature, and I also took on copywriting and presentation of our solution. I provided the team a general idea of what the solutions would look like and to ensure it follows our style guide. I also wrote the copywriting for our solutions and created a report and presentation to propose our solutions to the class and our client.</p>

    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    <p>This project helped me gain techniques and skills to understand our client which I can use in future projects academically and in my career. Not only did this project enhanced my design skills, I was also able to improve my leadership and problem solving skills as I led the team to the right direction and addressed the needs of our client.</p>
